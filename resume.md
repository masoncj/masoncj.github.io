I lead software development in the health tech space.  I love helping small companies launch products that help people. If you have an idea for an impactful product or service and need help making it, please get in touch.

Please see my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopher-mason-510a291/) or [complete resume](../images/resume/CMason Resume.pdf) for more details including publication history.

#### Brief experience summary

 (reverse chronologically)

* 3.5 years as founding Head of Engineering at Navio, leading development of patient/provider tools for cancer treatment and clinical trial support for this early stage company.
* 6 years at a genetic testing company, growing to Director of Engineering of digital interfaces for patients and providers (portals, EHR integration, provider workflow etc), as well as work on robotics, billing and insurance pricing estimation.  Our digital tools were cited as a key motivation for a $375M acquisition.
* 5 years in defense intelligence, spanning backend and frontend development and engineering management of analyst notebook software, bespoke RDF triple store.
* 1 year for a small protein-id software company, greenfield development of their second product for quality control of MS/MS data.
* 5 years in a lab at Mayo Clinic, working on algorithms/data analysis of proteomics, mostly for biomarker discovery via 2D-LC-MS/MS.
* While finishing school, led engineering for a DNA-resequencing-by-MS-proteomics diagnostics startup.
* BS CS/Biology CMU.
